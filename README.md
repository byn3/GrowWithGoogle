# gwg18 - Grow With Google Challenge Scholarship 2018

TLDR: Top 1% of the challenge program got chosen for a free nanodegree. Basically, Google|Udacity got 100k+ applicants, 15k chosen for phase 1, 1.5k moved on to the phase 2 nanodegree (Udacity's educational product). Other tracks do exist like the Android dev, I am in web dev.

In January 2018, Udacity selected 15,000 individuals for phase 1 of the Grow with Google challenge. Out of 100k+ applicants, I was one of the scholarship recipients. For 3 months (Jan, Feb, Mar) thousands of phase 1 students built a community to learn the basics of web development, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. I met fellow recipients at local meetups and helped loads of other students with the material via forums and Slack.

In April, the top 1,500 individuals were awarded a full scholarship for Udacity's Front-End Web Development Nanodegree program. Included were 6 months of material to pilot students towards FE web dev. The course ends in October. We will be focused on the trinity (HTML, CSS, JS), the DOM, browser events, JS objects and tooling, automation and testing, and version control with git. We will use framworks like Angular, React, and Ember. The many projects and lab assignments include making web apps: a memory game, a basic Yelp clone, a Feed reader, to name a few.
