			<p class="summary">Obviously a man with a sense of humor, Bryan seems to enjoy taking his time to amuse himself. If left alone in a panic room, Bryan lasts longer than an average human due to his high stat distribution into high mental health. Other people may view him as conniving, inappropriately sexy, calm, introverted, or a dad. He is constantly trying to help the people of GwG but is vastly behind the frontline pack. He likes spicey memes.</p>
